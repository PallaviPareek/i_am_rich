# I Am Rich App

"I Am Rich" is a simple Flutter app created with the Dart programming language. It will run on both iOS and Android devices.

 * This is the first and most basic project in Dr. Angela Yu's course "The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart." 
 * I started learning flutter two days ago, and with the aid of this course, I was able to develop a very basic application today.
 * When we open this app, an image will be displayed in the centre, along with an app bar containing the text "I am rich."

I'm excited to learn new things from this course in the future.:thumbsup: :smile:
